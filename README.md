# HTML-CSS-UI-CLONES
Welcome to my personal collection of UI clones for various popular websites, all crafted by hand using HTML and CSS. This repository showcases my ability to recreate complex user interfaces using fundamental web technologies.


## What I've Created:

Multiple website UI clones, each built from scratch
Implementations using pure HTML and CSS, no frameworks
Responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes
Careful attention to detail in replicating layouts and styles

This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and my eye for modern web design. Each clone represents hours of work to accurately reproduce the look and feel of well-known websites.

Feel free to explore my work, use it for learning inspiration, or reach out if you have any questions about my process!
